MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ASSIGNMENT:

Read the Information Retrieval Assignment Report.pdf for more information about this assignment and Its implementation algorithm details.

HOW TO RUN:

1> Install python 2.5+ version in machine. Open Index.py (code).

2> (Single Program)The source code of Indexing and Retrieval both are in Index.py.

3> To run it just load this Index.py into spyder, run python Index.py. will get below results in cmd prompt

	C:\workspace\Test>Index.py
	Document Retrieval Process started...
	Program will load the documents, queries and stop_list words from the files
	documents.txt, queries.txt and stop_list.txt respectively
	Documents Index building: 5.0720000267
	Documents TF_IDF processing: 0.743999958038
	Query Index building: 0.047000169754
	Query TF_IDF processing: 0.0
	Process Query with Documents and Produce results: 0.686000108719
	Document Retrieval process completed and the results are stored in "Result.txt"

	
4> Then open the Results.txt in file (Firstly it is zero bytes once code is run then it contains 13kb file) 

5> Information retrieval Results will be displayed.
